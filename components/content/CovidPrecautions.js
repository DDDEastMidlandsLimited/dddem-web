        Having spoken to several of our ticket holders we found
        that we had several delegates with underlying health issues -
        including one of our organising team - and a lot of nervous
        attendees.
      </p>
      <p tabIndex="0">
        DDD East Midlands Conference was an inclusive event to
        celebrate and explore the great technical talent across the
        region, so we didn’t want you spending the day anxious about
        covid, we wanted you to be having fun!
      </p>
      <p tabIndex="0">
        To ensure the event was as safe as possible for all in
        attendance we took the following precautions and asked
        that you help us by cooperating with them.
      </p>
      <h2 tabIndex="0">On arrival at the event</h2>
      <p tabIndex="0">When you arrived we did the following:</p>
      <br />
      <h3 tabIndex="0">Check your temperature</h3>
      <p tabIndex="0">
        We did this by using a "thermometer gun," a device that is
        equipped with an infrared sensor that can quickly measure
        surface temperature without making any contact with a person's
        skin.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3 tabIndex="0">
        Prove you have had a negative result on a lateral flow test in
        the last 24-48 hours
      </h3>
      <p tabIndex="0">
        We asked you to do this by entering your negative result
        at
        <a
          href="https://test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/report-result/login-choice"
          target="_blank"

          https://test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/report-result/login-choice.
        </a>
        From this you received an email or text message to confirm
        your negative result, which we asked you to show us upon
        arrival.
      </p>
      <p tabIndex="0">
        <b>If you could not prove a negative lateral flow result</b> we
        had a testing area at the venue where you were asked
        to do one in real time before joining the conference. Please
        bear in mind this took 30 mins as a minimum so arrive
        early!
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3 tabIndex="0">Ask you to choose a wrist band.</h3>
      <p tabIndex="0">
        The wrist band indicated if you were socially distancing or
        not.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Red band:</b> Please keep your distance.{' '}
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Green band:</b> I'm not socially distancing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p tabIndex="0">
        We thanked you in advance for being respectful about peoples
        choices around their social distancing requirements.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2 tabIndex="0">Throughout the day</h2>
      <ul tabIndex="0">
        <li tabIndex="0">
          It was not a socially distanced conference so there was no
          requirement for you to keep your distance from your friends,
          but please be respectful of others who may want to keep
          their distance.
        </li>

        <li tabIndex="0">
          Face mask wearing was optional, depending on your
          comfort levels.
        </li>
        <li tabIndex="0">
          We provided hand sanitiser around the venue for use
          throughout the day
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 tabIndex="0">Thank you for your patience</h2>
      <p tabIndex="0">
        These additional checks meant it took a little longer to
        check you in than we would usually like, but hoped you
        understood we were taking these precautions so that everyone
        felt safe and relaxed and could enjoy the event.
