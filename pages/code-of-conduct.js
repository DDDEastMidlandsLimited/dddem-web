          Treat everyone in a respectful and kind manner. Harassment
          and abuse are never tolerated. If you are in a situation
          that makes you uncomfortable at a DDD East Midlands event,
          if the event itself is creating an unsafe or inappropriate
          environment or you are made to feel uncomfortable by anyone
          at any of our events or in our online communities,

        <p tabIndex="0">
          Inclusivity is a core value of DDD East Midlands. We believe
          that every single person has the right to take part in DDD
          East Midlands events and online communities in a safe and
          welcoming environment.
        </p>
        <p tabIndex="0">
          In order to avoid any situtations where an attendee may feel
          uncomfortable we ask that you not only treat others in the
          manner that you would expect to be treated, but also to
          respect what makes other people feel comfortable. As part of
          this we ask that speakers and representatives of the event
          try to refrain from language or actions that may be
          considered offensive. This includes swearing.
        </p>
        <p tabIndex="0">
          Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal
          or written comments related to gender, age, sexual
          orientation, sexual behaviour, disability, physical
          appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in
          public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
          harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of
          talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and
          unwelcome sexual attention.
        </p>
        <p tabIndex="0">
          If what youâ€™re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable,
          that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing
          it.
        </p>
        <p tabIndex="0">
          Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are
          expected to comply immediately. Sponsors, venue staff,
          speakers, volunteers, organisers, and anyone else at any of
          our events or in our online communities are also subject to
          the anti-harassment policy. In particular, attendees should
          not use sexualised images, humour, activities, or other
          material in presentations, during events and on our online
          community.

          If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, DDD East
          Midlands may take any action DDD East Midlands deems
