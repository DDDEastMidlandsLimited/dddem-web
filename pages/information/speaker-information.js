            <h2>Attendees can vote using a traffic light system.</h2>
           <p>
               During the day there will boxes outside each room for attendees to put their votes into. All votes will be 
               conducted with a traffic light system:
           </p>
           <ul>
                <strong><li className="green">Green - That talk was EPIC</li>
                <li className="yellow">Yellow  - That talk was good</li>
                <li className="red">Red  - That talk wasn't for me.</li></strong>
            </ul>
            <p>
                There are a couple of reasons we have this voting system in place:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>To give our speakers some light indication around the reception of their talks.</strong> We cannot offer more in-depth means of feedback this 
                    year as it would require a level of moderation and work that, unfortunately, we don't have the time to invest in this first year.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>To give us an indication of which subject areas are of particular interest in the local area.</strong> This is not for any future talk 
                    curation, but to give us more knowledge about the local area so that we can help our sponsors target their efforts appropriately, 
                    and to aid us in our own marketing efforts.

                At least one of the organisers will be at the registration desk in the morning.

            <p>            
                Due to venue insurance restrictions, we need to be sure that anything that may be plugged 
                into a socket on the day <strong>either:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Has a current PAT test sticker/certificate</li>
                <li>Is less than one year old. Please ensure that where electrical items are less than a year old, evidence of this is provided.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This includes any laptop chargers or phone chargers.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will provide limited PAT testing on the day, with speakers being priority candidates for this service.
                This service will be available between <strong>7.30am - 9.30am the day of the conference</strong>. Registration for the 
                event opens to the general public at 8.00am so there is a window in the morning where exclusively speakers and exhibitors can 
                queue to get their devices PAT tested.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you will need your laptop cables PAT tested but cannot make it to the venue between those hours, contact Jessica to arrange 
                dropping off your chargers the evening before.

            <p>
                On the day there will be a speakers green room. Here you can practice or prepare for your talk, or just get some peace away 
                from the hustle and bustle of the conference.

                A visualiser will be set up in the Speakers Green Room so that you can try it out before you do your talk.

            <p>
                This is so that there is enough time to get you all set up.

            <h4>Introduce yourself to the crew member looking after your room.</h4>
            <p>
                The crew member will make sure there is water, and will be happy to help you with your presentation
                needs. They will also help us make sure everything is running smoothly in your room. Please let them know 
                if there is anything we can provide to help you.

            <h4>Meet the AV technician and get Mic'd up</h4>
            <p>
                There are a variety of microphones available in each room. Clip-on, static and hand held are available, so 
                please let the technicians know if you have a preference.

            <p>
                We can provide 3 clickers for the day (one per room). So if you do use one of the clickers provided, please
                make sure it stays in the room for the next speaker who might need it.

                We'll provide a space in the breakout area with a table and chair. Book in a time slot with Jessica, and you can advertise
                during or at the end of your talk that you will be available there to be approached by attendees after your talk.

            <li>For future conference submissions. Often conference submissions are strengthened with the evidence of your presentation skills.</li>

                        Talk topics have an emphasis on humour. Often the content is not suitable to be shared away 
                        from the safety of PubConf.

                        PubConf is a separate entity and business from DDD East Midlands. As such they have their own 
                        Code of Conduct. Hence "Unofficial" after party. We are not involved in its organisation.

            <h2>Taking the train</h2>
            <h4>Head to Nottingham Train Station</h4>
            <p>
                Nottingham Station is the mainline train station close to Nottingham city centre. The train station is a
                15 minute walk from Nottingham Conference Centre, but for those new to the city, it might be easier to
                take a taxi or use Nottinghamâ€™s tram NET (Nottingham Express Transit) system. Directions to the station
                tram stop are signposted throughout the train station building. The Conference Centre is located between
                the Royal Centre and Nottingham Trent University tram stop. Take a tram heading to either Phoenix Park
                or Hucknall. Exit the tram at the Royal Centre, continue down Goldsmith Street taking the first right
                turn onto Burton Street where you will find the Nottingham Conference Centre entrance on the left.
            </p>

            <h2>Driving</h2>
            <h4>Directions to Park and Rides</h4>
            <p>
                From the north, exit the M1 at junction 26 and follow the signs for the A610 towards Nottingham city
                centre.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a Park and Ride (tram) facility situated close to the M1 junction 26. The Park and Ride
                (Phoenix Park) site is clearly sign-posted off the A610. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Leave the tram at the Nottingham Trent University tram stop which is located on Goldsmith Street and walk past the main University entrance,
                turn left on to Burton Street where you will find the Nottingham Conference Centre entrance. 
            </p>
            <p>
                From the south, exit the M1 at junction 24 and follow the signs for the A453 to Nottingham city centre. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Queenâ€™s Drive Park and Ride is located just off the A453 (Queenâ€™s Drive), follow signs for A453 /
                Queenâ€™s Drive Industrial Estate and merge on to the A453 (Queenâ€™s Drive). The Park and Ride is located
                on the opposite side of the road to the retail park and is clearly sign-posted. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Alight from the Park and Ride bus on Lower Parliament Street (Victoria Centre); Nottingham Conference Centre is a short walk
                away.
            </p>

            <h4>Car parks</h4>
            <p>
                Car parks in the city centre are clearly signposted from all major approach routes. There are two car
                parks close to Nottingham Conference Centre, Trinity Square car park on North Church Street and Talbot

            <h4>From East Midlands Airport</h4>
            <p>
                The closest airport to Nottingham is East Midlands Airport which is 15 miles (approximately 24
                kilometres) outside of the city. It takes about half an hour from there to travel into the city by car
                or bus. There is a Skylink bus service that runs every half hour from the airport into Nottingham city
                centre and stops a few minutes walk away from Nottingham Conference Centre.
