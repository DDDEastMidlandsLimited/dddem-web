          You will be emailed a time slot closer to the event, in
          which you can bring a vehicle to the venue to collect any
          remaining items from your exhibition stall. This time slot
          will be somewhere between 16.30 â€“ 18.30 on the 3rd of
          October (the day of the event).
        </p>
        <p tabIndex="0">
          We have to arrange this into time slots due to the limited
          vehicle space at the venue. If there are any restrictions
          you have regarding time slot, or you donâ€™t think you will
          need one, please let us know in advance.
