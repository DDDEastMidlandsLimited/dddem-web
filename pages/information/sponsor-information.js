            <p>
                Nottingham Station is the mainline train station close to Nottingham city centre. The train station is a
                15 minute walk from Nottingham Conference Centre, but for those new to the city it might be easier to
                take a taxi or use Nottingham’s tram NET (Nottingham Express Transit) system. Directions to the station
                tram stop are signposted throughout the train station building. The Conference Centre is located between
                the Royal Centre and Nottingham Trent University tram stop. Take a tram heading to either Phoenix Park
                or Hucknall. Exit the tram at the Royal Centre, continue down Goldsmith Street taking the first right
                turn onto Burton Street where you will find the Nottingham Conference Centre entrance on the left.

            <p>
                From the north, exit the M1 at junction 26 and follow the signs for the A610 towards Nottingham city
                centre.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a Park and Ride (tram) facility situated close to the M1 junction 26. The Park and Ride
                (Phoenix Park) site is clearly sign-posted off the A610. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Leave the tram at the Nottingham Trent University tram stop which is located on Goldsmith Street and walk past the main University entrance,
                turn left on to Burton Street where you will find the Nottingham Conference Centre entrance. 
            </p>
            <p>
                From the south, exit the M1 at junction 24 and follow the signs for the A453 to Nottingham city centre. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Queen’s Drive Park and Ride is located just off the A453 (Queen’s Drive), follow signs for A453 /
                Queen’s Drive Industrial Estate and merge on to the A453 (Queen’s Drive). The Park and Ride is located

            </p>
            <p>
                Alight from the Park and Ride bus on Lower Parliament Street (Victoria Centre); Nottingham Conference Centre is a short walk
                away.

            <h2>Photographs</h2>
            <p>
                We will have a coloured lanyard system at the event to indicate whether attendees are OK with their photo being taken and used.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li className="green">Green — It’s fine for their photo to be taken</li>
                <li className="red">Red — Do not include me in your photos or promotional material</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We ask that you please respect this system and only use photos that have attendees with green lanyards only.

            <h2>Collecting your exhibition items.</h2>
            <p>
                You will be emailed a time slot closer to the event, in which you can bring a vehicle to the venue to collect any remaining items from your exhibition stall.  
                This time slot will be somewhere between 16.30 – 18.30 on the 26th of October (the day of the event).
            </p>
            <p>
                We have to arrange this into time slots due to the limited vehicle space at the venue. If there are any restrictions you have regarding time slot, 
                or you don’t think you will need one, please let us know in advance.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Location: </strong>We ask that you use the loading bay on South Sherwood Street.
