        You will be emailed a time slot closer to the event, in which
        you can bring a vehicle to the venue to collect any remaining
        items from your exhibition stall. This time slot will be
        somewhere between 16.30 – 18.30 on the 26th of October (the
        day of the event).
      </p>
      <p tabIndex="0">
        We have to arrange this into time slots due to the limited
        vehicle space at the venue. If there are any restrictions you
        have regarding time slot, or you don’t think you will need
        one, please let us know in advance.
