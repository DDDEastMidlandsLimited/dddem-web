                rewarding work and again the opportunity to volunteer

                Each event we support our speakers in hosting a

                this workshop Dylan teaches how to deliver fantastic
                presentations, which doesn't apply to just
                conferences, but are also skills most of us need in
                our day jobs. You can support us in being able to run
                this extra training.
