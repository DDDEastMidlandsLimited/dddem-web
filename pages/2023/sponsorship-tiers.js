              DDD East Midlands Conference has been a sold out event

              including networking, free training and inspiration;
              having a strong presence at the conference will reflect

              If your employees are wearing branded tops, they will

              Each event we support our speakers in hosting a Speakers
              Workshop by the magnificent Dylan Beattie. In this
              workshop Dylan teaches how to deliver fantastic
              presentations, which doesn't apply to just conferences,
              but are also skills most of us need in our day jobs. You
              can support us in being able to run this extra training.
