          Making a career change into technology is something we are

          to get into technology) and Project Function (free coding
          evening classes) have had a strong presence at DDD East

          For our 2023 event we are looking to invite numerous

          delegates to try something new in tech.

        <p tabIndex="0">
          As active members of the local tech community, the
          organisers of DDD East Midlands want to make submitting to
          the event as accessible to as many people as possible,
          offering their own support and time to realise this.
        </p>
        <p tabIndex="0">
          In previous years our organisers have toured around local
          meetups and universities giving guidance on what a good
          submission to speak should look like, and how to write one
          with your own personal style.

          Due to covid, this wasn't something that was possible for
          our 2021 event, however now meet-ups are starting to come
          back in-person, this is something we hope to revive for
          2023, where relevant.

          As in previous years, all speakers will be invited to attend
          a workshop ahead of time, on how to structure and present a
          talk as part of our mentorship scheme for first-time
          speakers.
        </p>
        <p tabIndex="0">
          Encouraging people to do their very first talk is something
          we continue to be passionate about, so speakers can indicate
          if they are first-time speakers and/or want additional
          support.

        <p tabIndex="0">
          We have some great mentors from the local community who are
          international speakers. They will help refine talk content
          and slides, as well as give feedback on how to improve the
          mentees presentation style.
