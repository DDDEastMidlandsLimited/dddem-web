                further integrate ourselves into the local tech
                community. Several of our team submitted talks & were
                selected to speak on the day, plus we had a great turn
                out at our booth where we were able to showcase the
                great stuff we’re doing here at Oakbrook. We have
                found it easier to attract talent since the day, and

                events!”
