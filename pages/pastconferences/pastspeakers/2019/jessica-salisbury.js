        <p tabIndex="0">
          From how the body knows when to stop growing to saving lives
          from speeding cars, the feedback loop is a mechanism that
          secretly underlies every corner of our existence. The
          concept spans schools of thought in psychology, economics,
          biology and neuroscience and is now emerging in the
          intersection of technology and behavioural science.
        </p>

          As technologists we are always looking to build products
          that are engaging and effective, and as people we strive to
          reach our full personal and working potential. Could the
          feedback loop be the piece we&apos;re all missing?
        </p>
        <p tabIndex="0">
          In this talk we&apos;ll dive into the structure of the
          feedback loop, some impressive examples of how powerful they
          can be and we&apos;ll explore how you can harness their
          power in your work and personal life.
