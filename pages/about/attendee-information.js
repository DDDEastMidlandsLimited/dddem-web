                tram stop are signposted throughout the train station building. The Conference Centre is located between
                the Royal Centre and Nottingham Trent University tram stop. Take a tram heading to either Phoenix Park

            <p tabIndex="0">
                After the conference, there will be a special <a href="https://pubconf.io/events/2019/nottingham/" target="_blank">PubConf</a> featuring some of our speakers and special guests. This 
                evening event has comedy talks, music, food and beverages. It's great fun for all and we encourage you to come along.

                        The talks conducted at PubConf are 5 minute, comedy ignite talks:
                    </li>
                    <li tabIndex="0">
                        20 slides timed to increment every 15 seconds. The speakers have no control
                    </li>
                    <li tabIndex="0">
                        The top three talks will go into a final battle to win prizes. These three finalists will be presented 
                        with a ignite deck they have never seen before and given a topic. They will then have to come up with an 
                        impromptu talk on the spot.
                    </li>
                    <li tabIndex="0">
                        Talk topics have an emphasis on humour. Often the content is not suitable to be shared away 
                        from the safety of PubConf.
                    </li>
                    <li tabIndex="0">
                        PubConf is a separate entity and business from DDD East Midlands. As such they have their own 
                        Code of Conduct. Hence "Unofficial" after party. We are not involved in its organisation.

                This is the first PubConf in the UK outside of London and it's going to be brilliant.
