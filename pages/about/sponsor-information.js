                After the conference, there will be a special <a href="https://pubconf.io/events/2019/nottingham/" target="_blank">PubConf</a> featuring some of our speakers and special guests. This 
                evening event has comedy talks, music, food and beverages. It's great fun for all and we encourage you to come along.

                        The top three talks will go into a final battle to win prizes. These three finalists will be presented 
                        with a ignite deck they have never seen before and given a topic. They will then have to come up with an 
                        impromptu talk on the spot.
