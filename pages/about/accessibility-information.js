                There will be a prayer room available on the day. It will be marked on the maps and all volunteers will know where it will be located.

                Unfortunately we will not be able to provide childcare at this first event. The overhead and cost were too high on this instance, but we would love to find a way in the future. Accessibility is important to us and we would love to make it easier for parents to attend the conference.

                Unfortunately, this isn't the case at this years event. The NCC is converting some of it's toilets to be gender neutral but this won't be in place until after the event.

                Both the Goldsmith Street entrance and the Burton street entrance are accessible and there are lifts to all levels. The wheelchair door on Burton Street is a push button entrance door.
