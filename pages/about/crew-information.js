            <h2>Taking the train</h2>
            <h4>Head to Nottingham Train Station</h4>
            <p>
                Nottingham Station is the mainline train station close to Nottingham city centre. The train station is a
                15 minute walk from Nottingham Conference Centre, but for those new to the city, it might be easier to
                take a taxi or use Nottinghamâ€™s tram NET (Nottingham Express Transit) system. Directions to the station
                tram stop are signposted throughout the train station building. The Conference Centre is located between
                the Royal Centre and Nottingham Trent University tram stop. Take a tram heading to either Phoenix Park
                or Hucknall. Exit the tram at the Royal Centre, continue down Goldsmith Street taking the first right
                turn onto Burton Street where you will find the Nottingham Conference Centre entrance on the left.
            </p>
            
            <a name="driving"/>
            <h2>Driving</h2>
            <h4>Directions to Park and Rides</h4>
            <p>
                From the north, exit the M1 at junction 26 and follow the signs for the A610 towards Nottingham city
                centre.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a Park and Ride (tram) facility situated close to the M1 junction 26. The Park and Ride
                (Phoenix Park) site is clearly sign-posted off the A610. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Leave the tram at the Nottingham Trent University tram stop which is located on Goldsmith Street and walk past the main University entrance,
                turn left on to Burton Street where you will find the Nottingham Conference Centre entrance. 
            </p>
            <p>
                From the south, exit the M1 at junction 24 and follow the signs for the A453 to Nottingham city centre. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Queenâ€™s Drive Park and Ride is located just off the A453 (Queenâ€™s Drive), follow signs for A453 /
                Queenâ€™s Drive Industrial Estate and merge on to the A453 (Queenâ€™s Drive). The Park and Ride is located
                on the opposite side of the road to the retail park and is clearly sign-posted. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Alight from the Park and Ride bus on Lower Parliament Street (Victoria Centre); Nottingham Conference Centre is a short walk
                away.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Car parks</h4>
            <p>
                Car parks in the city centre are clearly signposted from all major approach routes. There are two car
                parks close to Nottingham Conference Centre, Trinity Square car park on North Church Street and Talbot

        <h1>PubConf - The Unofficial After Party</h1> 

             <a name="after-party-about"/>
            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                After the conference, there will be a special <a href="https://pubconf.io/events/2019/nottingham/" target="_blank">PubConf</a> featuring some of our speakers and special guests. This 
                evening event has comedy talks, music, food and beverages. It's great fun for all and we encourage you to come along.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Quick about:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The talks conducted at PubConf are 5 minute, comedy ignite talks:
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        20 slides timed to increment every 15 seconds. The speakers have no control
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The top three talks will go into a final battle to win prizes. These three finalists will be presented 
                        with a ignite deck they have never seen before and given a topic. They will then have to come up with an 
                        impromptu talk on the spot.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Talk topics have an emphasis on humour. Often the content is not suitable to be shared away 
                        from the safety of PubConf.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        PubConf is a separate entity and business from DDD East Midlands. As such they have their own 
                        Code of Conduct. Hence "Unofficial" after party. We are not involved in its organisation.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the first PubConf in the UK outside of London and it's going to be brilliant.
