            <h2>Thank you.</h2>
            <p>
                Without your support, there wouldn’t be a DDD East Midlands event at all. This page outlines what you need to know on the day. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This year we expect around 350 - 400 attendees to join us in a day of learning and networking for the East Midlands technology community.

            <h2>Please Familiarise yourself with the Code of Conduct.</h2>
            <p>
               All involved in the DDD East Midlands Conference are subject to <a href="https://www.dddeastmidlands.com/code-of-conduct/">Code Of Conduct Page.</a>

            </p>
            <p>
                Please make sure you are familiar with it and adhere to it at all times to create the most inclusive and friendly event for all involved.

            <a name="tickets"/>
            <h2>Tickets</h2>
            <p>
                Depending on the sponsorship tier you have supported us with, you may have a number of tickets to the conference.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you know who your guaranteed tickets are going to be given to, please provide us with their emails so that we can send a link to Eventbrite. If this is still unsure, we can provide a code for you to access tickets with.
            </p>
            <p>
                We suggest that 2 - 3 of your tickets are given to those managing your exhibition booth. If you have more, you can give out internally, donate to local meetups, give away in competitions - what ever you think is best.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any tickets you consider “extra” as part of your sponsorship, you can dispense as you wish. Contact Jessica if you want assistance with this.

            <h2>PAT Testing</h2>
            <p>
                Any devices that will be plugged in during the day need to be PAT tested. They need to have a valid visible sticker on them or a certificate present. 
                Where possible, please try to get your devices PAT tested before the day. This includes any laptop chargers. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We are currently looking into having PAT testing available on the day. First priority will go to speakers and then to exhibitors if we do have the funding to provide this service.

            <a name="setup-time"/>
            <h2>Time To Setup</h2>
            <p>
                You will be emailed a time slot closer to the event, in which you can set up your exhibition stall. This time slot will be somewhere between 18.00 – 21.30 on the 25th of October (the night before the event).
            </p>
            <p>
                We have to arrange this into time slots due to the limited vehicle space at the venue. If there are any restrictions you have regarding time slot, please let us know in advance.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the day of the event, the organisers will be at the venue from 07.30. You may turn up any time from then. Attendee registration opens at 08.30.

            <p>
                Please use the loading bay on South Sherwood Street during your alloted time.
            </p>
            <p>
                The entrance to the South Sherwood Street loading bay on a busy road and right next to a bus stop. We ask that you do not obstruct this entrance, but instead, only park within the loading bay.
