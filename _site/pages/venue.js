                Nottingham Station is the mainline train station close to Nottingham city centre. The train station is a
                15 minute walk from Nottingham Conference Centre, but for those new to the city it might be easier to
                take a taxi or use Nottingham’s tram NET (Nottingham Express Transit) system. Directions to the station
                tram stop are signposted throughout the train station building. The Conference Centre is located between
                the Royal Centre and Nottingham Trent University tram stop. Take a tram heading to either Phoenix Park
                or Hucknall. Exit the tram at the Royal Centre, continue down Goldsmith Street taking the first right
                turn onto Burton Street where you will find the Nottingham Conference Centre entrance on the left.

                The closest airport to Nottingham is East Midlands Airport which is 15 miles (approximately 24
                kilometres) outside of the city. It takes about half an hour from there to travel into the city by car
                or bus. There is a Skylink bus service that runs every half hour from the airport into Nottingham city
                centre and stops a few minutes walk away from Nottingham Conference Centre.
