These days, most Testers understand that testing is more than test cases, that automation does not solve all problems, that having some technical skills & appreciation augments their work, that testing can occur before a product is built and after it has been released in production and so on & so on.\n\nBeing able to ship products of high enough quality is not just a matter of following instructions. It takes people, working together, in uncertain conditions to achieve the goal. Let’s break that down:\n\nPeople - Which means relationships, emotions, value systems, personal goals, skills thoughts, ideas and probably a whole lot more!\nUncertain conditions - What do we know? What do we know we don’t know? What do we need to know? Do we perceive the situation in the same way? Is there a common cause? How is disagreement handled? What about conflict?\n\nThat’s where the “Coach” part of the title comes in.\n\nCoaching can help overcome these challenges by supporting individuals, groups, teams and organisations to understand themselves and their work from new perspectives. It’s not “just soft skills” either!

Train tracks designed by a 4yo can be quite random and not very satisfying to actually play with - lines that disappear under the sofa, bridges to nowhere and surprise turntables in the middle of a track.\nSo I started to build my own tracks (when he was asleep, to prevent ‘helping’), but it was pretty labour-intensive and it turns out I prefer to spend my evenings doing… well almost anything else. So instead I developed an algorithm to generate tracks and then trained a 4yo-opinion-based ML model to determine whether the tracks were ‘fun’ or not.\n\nThis is the story of how I learned that ‘developing an algorithm’ is not as easy as it sounds, and that ‘fun’ has different meanings depending on whether you are 4, 34 or a computer.",level:"Introductory and overview",tags:["machine learning","demo"],lengths:["60 minute talk","30 minute talk"]},{id:27,title:"Functional Programming with C#",description:"Functional Programming is becoming increasingly popular and relevant with each year that goes by.
