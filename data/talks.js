However, with dotnet core, things have changed, it's never been easier to implement effective visibility into how your application is performing in production.\n\nIn this session I will cover the fundamental differences between Metrics and Logs, and Events and look at where one is useful over the other.\n\nWe’ll look at some of the things Microsoft has done in dotnet core to make logging easier, and some of the third-party libraries and tools that aim to make it easier to navigate.\n\nWe’ll cover tools like Serilog and Log4Net, along with AppMetrics for capturing application information. We’ll then take a quick look at Grafana, and see how we can make some sense of that information.  Finally, we'll look at Honeycomb.io and how they're providing actionable insights for distributed systems using events, enabling testing in production.","level":"Introductory and overview","tags":["devops","observability","metrics/dashboarding","monitoring"]},{"id":2,"title":"Functional Programming with C#","description":"Functional Programming is becoming increasingly popular and relevant with each year that goes by.

Or do you have a vague memory of once hearing about a mythical beast called 'formal specification languages', which would one day save the world?\n\nLet’s step back a bit.\n\nWhen is the best time to catch a design flaw? Clearly it’s during the design stage, before a line of code has been written. But in reality, all too often design flaws come to light late in the development lifecycle (and this is why any self-respecting team invests in first-rate QA practices). Worse still, design flaws can emerge when the system is in live operation. If you’re building control software for aeroplanes, self-driving cars or nuclear power plants, then a simple design flaw can have catastrophic consequences.\n\nLuckily, for most of us, lives don’t depend on us getting our code right first time. But livelihoods might. If you’re a startup, you’ve typically got one shot at capturing the imagination of your target customers. If your system has a design flaw that ruins their experience, chances are that’s your opportunity missed. And as more teams adopt microservices, for all the benefits of that architectural style, one of the downsides is that it is very hard for our brains to reason about the complex operational states of distributed, concurrent systems. Potential race conditions, deadlocks and cascading failures are hard to spot in system design, and equally hard to test for. How do we reduce the risk of introducing such flaws when the system consists of large numbers of interacting, independent services?\n\nGetting better at system specification is a problem for our whole profession, whether we’re building business applications or control systems for nuclear submarines. In this talk, I will give an introduction to a formal specification language called TLA+,  which has broken out of the Computer Science lab and is now being used for real world projects at Amazon, Microsoft… and at our little Nottingham-based startup.

Does every service need to have a list of all our users? Who knows what users have permissions to the entities within the micro service? What happens if my REST endpoint needs to include data from a graph that includes other services to make it responsive? And I am not breaking the boundary of my service when all of this data leaves my service boundary in response to a request?\n\nNaive request-based solutions result in chatty calls as each service engages with multiple other services to fulfil a request, or in large message payloads as services add all the data required to process a message to each message. Neither scale well.\n\nIn 2005, Pat Helland wrote a paper ‘Data on the Inside vs. Data on the Outside’ which answers the question by distinguishing between data a service owns and reference data that it can use. Martin Fowler named the resulting architectural style; Event Driven Collaboration.

Recently released, Azure Front Door Service cost-effectively brings the same power to our own applications with little effort.\n\nThis session will dive in to the world of using AFD (and related Azure services) to add enterprise-grade resilience to a globally distributed application.\n\nWe'll see how easy it is to visualise and control traffic across a geo-redundant multi-cloud setup, and the performance improvements AFD can make on end users through configurable routing, caching, and SSL termination at the edge.\n\nFinally, we'll configure our failover setup to ensure our application is rarely unavailable before putting it through it's paces by simulating a range of system failures (500 errors, cold starts, DoS) to watch AFD gracefully handle it with minimal impact on end users.","level":"Introductory and overview","tags":["cloud","demo"]},{"id":117,"title":"The Power of the Feedback Loop","description":"From how the body knows when to stop growing to saving lives from speeding cars, the feedback loop is a mechanism that secretly underlies every corner of our existence. The concept spans schools of thought in psychology, economics, biology and neuroscience and is now emerging in the intersection of technology and behavioural science. \n\nAs technologists we are always looking to build products that are engaging and effective, and as people we strive to reach our full personal and working potential. Could the feedback loop be the piece we're all missing?\n\nIn this talk we'll dive into the structure of the feedback loop, some impressive examples of how powerful they can be and we'll explore how you can harness their power in your work and personal life.","level":"Introductory and overview","tags":["softskills/workskills","design","ux","behavioural science"]},{"id":118,"title":"An IoT MOT - Let’s DDD it Live!","description":"In this session, we’ll explore various Internet of Things platforms and the challenges of maintaining IoT devices and systems themselves (“Maintenance of Things”). Covering aspects such as Design, Testing, Continuous Integration and Deployment. Also includes live on stage demos.","level":"Intermediate","tags":["iot","hardware","cloud","architecture","demo","security","testing"]},{"id":119,"title":"Count your steps, count your blessings: A Citical Look at Self-Care Tech","description":"People meditate with their phones, practise yoga with their gaming consoles and let their personalised fitness tracker comment on their quality of sleep – technology-facilitated self-care is everywhere. Somewhere in between the mountains of personal data being collected, analysed and displayed to people, lies a small question: What does this actually mean for us?\n\nThis (slightly experimental & very personal) talk will explore ideas about the quantified self from a critical standpoint. It aims to shine a light on the complex implications found within self-care tech and explore the underlying research and design assumptions. Conceptualising empathy, compassion and what it means to help in/outside/through technology will form the very baseline of this talk.\n\nThis talk will draw on the speaker’s personal artistic practise and their academic research in Human Computer Interaction. It will present a range of ideas on how to engage with therapeutic technologies on a deeper, personal level, but also from a societal, justice-oriented stance.","level":"Introductory and overview","tags":["software methodology/process","design","ux","ui","healthcare"]},{"id":120,"title":"Put some Wifi in my Toaster (and Call it a Day?)","description":"With a single tap on your phone, you can activate your washing machine remotely, have your smoke alarm tell you if your house is on fire (or not!) and use your fridge to organise your calendar meetings: Ubiquitous computing and internet-connected technology is everywhere. Gone are the days of duct-taping a battery pack and a modem to your couch: Sleekly designed products that claim to make everyday easier are being released at a fast pace. \n\nHowever, a lot of these products are very “solution-first” and do not take into account how people actually use technology – often leading to complaints and ridicule from the community down the line. This talk will explore what it means to use technology and how we can challenge and test our own assumptions about the world.\n\nDrawing on methods found in Human Computer Interaction research, this talk will introduce a toolkit to discover and test design assumptions about technology that are grounded in everyday life. It will also discuss what it means to create technology from a wider perspective and offer some ideas to develop best practises within your own work environment.","level":"Introductory and overview","tags":["software methodology/process","iot","ui","ux","design"]},{"id":121,"title":"Appsolutely Fabulous","description":"Whilst there is a very good cross platform client application (app) development story for .NET, its also very much built on OO patterns.\n\nFabulous is a functional first approach using F# - built on Xamarin forms that does away with the view model.\n\nThis talk aims to show just enough Fabulous to be dangerous - with a little bit of background and a little bit of live code to illustrate the possibilities - in the hope of inspiring further investigation.","level":"Introductory and overview","tags":["functional programming","mobile"]},{"id":122,"title":"Deep Learning in the world of little ponies","description":"In this talk, we will discuss computer vision, one of the most common real-world applications of machine learning. We will deep dive into various state-of-the-art concepts around building custom image classifiers - application of deep neural networks, specifically convolutional neural networks and transfer learning. We will demonstrate how those approaches could be used to create your own image classifier to recognise the characters of \"My Little Pony\" TV Series [or Pokemon, or Superheroes, or your custom images].","level":"Introductory and overview","tags":["machine learning","artificial intelligence"]},{"id":123,"title":"Bring your ML models to life (and production) using DevOps practices","description":"So your data science teams have been running ML experiments for some time using local or cloud environment and found some great insights? And the question now is how to take it further and bring those to the production by using known and proven DevOps practices. At this session we will look at how to build and scale such ML DevOps pipelines using various approaches.","level":"Intermediate","tags":["machine learning","devops"]},{"id":124,"title":"So what is this GraphQL thing anyway and why should I care?","description":"For some time the default method for access an API has been REST (or more usually CRUD over http). This can be an effective solution but its not without challenges, so what if there were another way...\n\nGraphQL is an alternative way to provide an API to your clients that addresses some of the issues commonly found with Rest.\n\nThis talk aims to provide an introduction to the GraphQL query language and to show the code needed to create a GraphQL server (in .NET).","level":"Introductory and overview","tags":[]},{"id":125,"title":"How I won £500 at Royal Ascot And What That Can Teach You About Data Science","description":"Machine Learning is simple when you have lots of labelled data, but what do you do when the system you’re trying to predict is mostly stochastic in nature? In this fascinating talk I’ll explain how we can combine data science techniques to tame the stochastic nature of horse racing and make some remarkably accurate racing predictions. I’ll use these techniques to live predict the result of a race running on the day, and we’ll make a small bet on the outcome.","level":"Intermediate","tags":["machine learning","artificial intelligence"]}]
