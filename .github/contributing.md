## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

When issuing a bug report please include as many of details on [the bug report template](./ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) as possible. If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one. Please label the any bug report issues with `bug`

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancements may include completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

First of all please do a search on the issues already present to see if it's an enhancement that hasn't previously been suggested. If it has, maybe join the discussion on the pre-existing issue. This is to help reduce duplication of issues. If it hasn't been raised previously, please include as many details as you can using [the feature request template](./ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md). Label the raised feature request as `enhancement`.

### Labels For Issues

### Pull Requests

- Create branch. Give it a descriptive name relating to what the work covers. See some examples below.

| PR-prefix | Category    | Example                     |
| --------- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| e/        | enhancement | e/improveperformanceofquery |
| b/        | bug         | bug/acceptnullsforinput     |

- Open a Pull Request with the details listed in the [pull request template](../pull_request_template.md). The sections of this template should show in the body of any new pull request automatically.

- Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible.

- Make a comment with the pull request in any issues it relates to.

### Your First Code Contribution?

We will make efforts to label issues with `beginner` if we think they should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two. This is in order to help those who want to contribute but don't necessarily have much experience in doing so.

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

We request that, where possible, you stick to the following format for your commit messages.

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- After the first line, be descriptive about what has been done in the commit.

For reference, [this blog](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) encourages a similar style.

## Licencing

If it's something cool, new and funky that you are contributing, please ensure it's covered with an MIT licence.
